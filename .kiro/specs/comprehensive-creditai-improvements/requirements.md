- **Mobile Experience**: Poor responsiveness, 25% completion rate
- **Infrastructure**: Complex configuration, limited monitoring

### Business Impact
- **User Satisfaction**: 3.2/5 rating
- **Dispute Submission Rate**: Only 15% of users complete disputes
- **Mobile Usage**: 60% of users on mobile with suboptimal experience
- **Processing Abandonment**: Users leave during long processing times
