# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will establish a complete Google Cloud infrastructure setup with Document AI and Vision API services, configure all necessary environment variables with actual credentials, and set up a comprehensive database system for storing monitoring data and user feedback. This infrastructure will support reliable PDF processing and comprehensive system monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to set up a complete Google Cloud project with Document AI and Vision API services, so that the application can process PDF documents reliably with proper service configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up Google Cloud THEN the system SHALL create a new Google Cloud project with billing enabled
2. WHEN configuring services THEN the system SHALL enable Document AI API and Vision API with proper quotas
3. WHEN creating processors THEN the system SHALL set up Document AI processors for credit report processing
4. WHEN configuring authentication THEN the system SHALL create service accounts with minimal required permissions
5. WHEN testing connectivity THEN the system SHALL validate all Google Cloud services are accessible and functional

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all environment variables configured with actual Google Cloud credentials, so that the application can authenticate and use Google Cloud services in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring credentials THEN the system SHALL set up service account JSON keys with proper permissions
2. WHEN setting environment variables THEN the system SHALL configure all required Google Cloud environment variables
3. WHEN validating configuration THEN the system SHALL test authentication and service access
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL ensure credentials work in development, staging, and production environments
5. WHEN securing credentials THEN the system SHALL follow security best practices for credential storage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive database setup for monitoring data and feedback storage, so that we can track system performance and user interactions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up monitoring THEN the system SHALL create database tables for PDF processing metrics
2. WHEN storing feedback THEN the system SHALL create tables for user feedback and system performance data
3. WHEN tracking usage THEN the system SHALL create tables for API usage analytics and error tracking
4. WHEN implementing security THEN the system SHALL set up proper database permissions and access controls
5. WHEN ensuring reliability THEN the system SHALL configure database backups and recovery procedures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated setup scripts and validation tools, so that the Google Cloud infrastructure can be deployed consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automating setup THEN the system SHALL provide scripts for complete Google Cloud project initialization
2. WHEN validating deployment THEN the system SHALL include validation scripts to test all services
3. WHEN documenting setup THEN the system SHALL provide clear step-by-step setup instructions
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL include diagnostic tools for common configuration issues
5. WHEN maintaining infrastructure THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and alerting for service health

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want proper security configurations and monitoring, so that the Google Cloud infrastructure follows security best practices and compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring security THEN the system SHALL implement least-privilege access controls
2. WHEN monitoring access THEN the system SHALL set up audit logging for all service interactions
3. WHEN protecting data THEN the system SHALL configure encryption for data in transit and at rest
4. WHEN managing credentials THEN the system SHALL implement secure credential rotation procedures
5. WHEN ensuring compliance THEN the system SHALL configure monitoring for security events and anomalies
